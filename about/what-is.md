## Developer Comment

This is Suxa (suxamethonium), creator of Hakoniwa Explorer Plus.

Originally, this was never intended to be made into a game, but as I went along adding all sorts of new elements and stuff, at some point it kinda became the kind of game that lots of people could enjoy.

Then I somehow got a publisher attached, and now it seems the game has actually managed to make it out to market, which is unbelievable.

I appear in the game myself, so if you like, please come find me and say hi.
